1. Write a program to exchange the content of two variables without using the third variable.


2. Write two C functions in the same program to do the following:
Take as input a positive integer 'n' from the user, where n>=0. 
- (a) Compute the factorial of 'n' in a iterative fashion. 
- (b) Compute the factorial of 'n' in a recursive fashion. 


3. Write two C functions in the same program to do the following.
Take as input a positive integer 'n' from the user. 
- (a) Compute the Fibonacci number corresponding to 'n' in a iterative fashion. 
- (b) Compute the Fibonacci number corresponding to 'n' in a recursive fashion.
 Compute the number of function calls to any 'fib(i)', where 0<=i<=n.
In both cases, check what is the largest 'n' for which you can find the Fibonacci number. For any particular 'n', compute and compare the real times taken by the iterative and recursive versions of the program. 


4. Write a program to evaluate the function sin(x) as defined by the series expansion,
 - (a)  sin(x) = x/1! â€“ x^3/3! + x^5/5! - x^7/7! + ---- upto n terms


5. Write a program to find square root of given number n using a user-defined function.


6. Given two positive non-zero integers n and m, write a program for finding their greatest 
common devisor (gcd).


7. Write a program to reverse the digits of a given integer.


8. Write a program to convert a given decimal number into binary, octal and hexadecimal 
equivalents.


9. Write a program to compute all the prime factors of a given integer.


10. A Company wants to transmit data over telephone but they are concerned that their phone may be tapped. All of their data is transmitted as four digit integers. They have asked you to write a program  that will encrypt their data so that it may be transmitted more securely. Your program should read a  four digits integer and encrypt it as follows
  - (a) Replace each digit by (the sum of that digit and 7) modulus 10.
  - (b) Then swap the first digit with third, and second with the fourth. Write a program for it.
  - (c) Then print the encrypted integer. Write a separate program that inputs an encrypted four-digit integer, and decrypt it to form the original number.


11. Write program to generate a uniform set of pseudo-random numbers using linear congruential method. Successive members of the linear congruential sequence (x) are generated using the expression:2 xn+1 = (axn + b) mod m for n >= 0, where the parameters a,b,m,x0 must be chosen in advance according to certain criteria. The parameters a, b and m are referred to as multiplier, increment and modulus respectively and their values should be greater than or equal to zero and m should be greater than x0, a and b.


12. Given some integer x, write a program to compute the value of xn where n is positive number considerably greater than 1.


13. Write a program to find all the prime numbers lying between 100 and 200 using user-defined function.


14. Write a program to demonstrate the Longest Common Subsequence.


15. Write a program to implement the algorithm to search an element in an array of N elements 
using linear search and binary search and determine the time to search the element in each 
case.
