1. Write a program to exchange the content of two variables without using the third variable.


2. Write two C functions in the same program to do the following:
Take as input a positive integer 'n' from the user, where n>=0. 
- (a) Compute the factorial of 'n' in a iterative fashion. 
- (b) Compute the factorial of 'n' in a recursive fashion. 


3. Write two C functions in the same program to do the following.
Take as input a positive integer 'n' from the user. 
- (a) Compute the Fibonacci number corresponding to 'n' in a iterative fashion. 
- (b) Compute the Fibonacci number corresponding to 'n' in a recursive fashion.
 
Compute the number of function calls to any 'fib(i)', where 0<=i<=n.
In both cases, check what is the largest 'n' for which you can find the Fibonacci number. For any 
particular 'n', compute and compare the real times taken by the iterative and recursive versions 
of the program.
